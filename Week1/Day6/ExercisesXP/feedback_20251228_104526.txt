suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 2, the conditional logic is flawed. It should use `elif` to avoid unintended cost assignments.
- Exercise 2 does not calculate and print the total cost correctly. It needs to accumulate the cost for each family member.
- In Exercise 3, it could be more descriptive about the zara's client:  print(f"Zara's clients are: {', '.join(brand['type_of_ clothes'])}.")
- In Exercise 4, the `users.sort()` method modifies the list in-place and returns `None`.  You should sort a copy of the list instead to avoid unexpected behavior.
- In Exercise 4, disney3 has to be assigned after users.sort() method has been used
Brief justification:
- correctness: Exercise 1,3,4 are correctly implemented according to the problem description. Exercise 2 contains an error in conditionnal logic, it does not provide correct total cost calculation. Therefore, correctness is 75%
- readability: The code is generally readable, with adequate comments and spacing. However, the formatting in Exercise 2 can be improved.
- performance: The code is efficient for the given tasks. It uses appropriate data structures and algorithms.
- security: There are no security concerns in this code.
