# Exercise 1: Converting Lists into Dictionaries
# Key Python Topics:

# Creating dictionaries
# Zip function or dictionary comprehension


# Instructions
# You are given two lists. Convert them into a dictionary where the first list contains the keys and the second list contains the corresponding values.



# Lists:

keys = ['Ten', 'Twenty', 'Thirty']
values = [10, 20, 30]

my_dict1 = dict(zip(keys, values))

print(my_dict1)

# Expected Output:

# {'Ten': 10, 'Twenty': 20, 'Thirty': 30}

# Exercise 2: Cinemax #2
# Key Python Topics:

# Looping through dictionaries
# Conditionals
# Calculations


# Instructions
# Write a program that calculates the total cost of movie tickets for a family based on their ages.

# Family members’ ages are stored in a dictionary.
# The ticket pricing rules are as follows:
# Under 3 years old: Free
# 3 to 12 years old: $10
# Over 12 years old: $15


# Family Data:
free = 0
child = 10
adult = 15

total_cost = 0

family = {"rick": 43, 'beth': 13, 'morty': 5, 'summer': 8}

for age in family.values():
    print({age})
    if age < 3:
        cost = free
    if age >= 3 or age <= 12:
        cost = child

    if age > 12:
        cost = adult
   

# total_cost = sum(cost)

# print(total_cost)



# Loop through the family dictionary to calculate the total cost.
# Print the ticket price for each family member.
# Print the total cost at the end.


# Bonus:

# Allow the user to input family members’ names and ages, then calculate the total ticket cost.

# Exercise 3: Zara
# Key Python Topics:

# Creating dictionaries
# Accessing and modifying dictionary elements
# Dictionary methods like .pop() and .update()


# Instructions
# Create and manipulate a dictionary that contains information about the Zara brand.

brand = {
    "name": "Zara"
    creation_date: 1975
    creator_name: "Amancio Ortega Gaona"
    type_of_clothes: "men", "women", "children", "home"
    international_competitors: "Gap", "H&M", "Benetton"
    number_stores: 7000
    major_color: 
        France: blue, 
        Spain: red, 
        US: pink, green
}

# Brand Information:




# Create a dictionary called brand with the provided data.
# Modify and access the dictionary as follows:
# Change the value of number_stores to 2.
# Print a sentence describing Zara’s clients using the type_of_clothes key.
# Add a new key country_creation with the value Spain.
# Check if international_competitors exists and, if so, add “Desigual” to the list.
# Delete the creation_date key.
# Print the last item in international_competitors.
# Print the major colors in the US.
# Print the number of keys in the dictionary.
# Print all keys of the dictionary.


# Bonus:

# Create another dictionary called more_on_zara with creation_date and number_stores. Merge this dictionary with the original brand dictionary and print the result.
