suggestions for improvement:
- The board representation could be improved to use a 2D list as suggested in the instructions, though the dictionary works.
- The input validation could be more robust. While it checks if the move is in the grid, it could also check if the input is an integer to avoid errors.
- Consider adding an option to play again after the game ends.
Brief justification:
- correctness: The code implements the Tic Tac Toe game as described in the chapter content, including displaying the board, getting player input, checking for a winner, and checking for a tie. It fulfills all major requirements. The primary deviation from the instructions is the use of a dictionary instead of a 2D list for the board, which is a functional but less direct implementation of the instructions. It does create the game, manages turns, prompts for player input, checks win conditions and declares the winner.
- readability: The code is generally well-readable, with clear function names and comments. The board representation and win-checking logic could be slightly improved for better clarity.
- performance: The code's performance is adequate for the Tic Tac Toe game. There are no performance bottlenecks.
- security: The code does not have any major security vulnerabilities. Input validation is present, preventing some common errors. The input could still cause errors as non-integer values are not handled.
